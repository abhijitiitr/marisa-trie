Matching Algorithms with Recursively Implemented StorAge (alpha)

0.1.5

- Description

This project *marisa-trie-alpha* provides a C++ library *libmarisa_alpha* and command line tools *`marisa-alpha-*`* for building and operating nesting patricia tries. The brand-new dictionary structure is designed to be static and space efficient. Also, *marisa-trie-alpha* enables not only simple lookups but also prefix searches and predictive searches.

 * Prefix searches are to find keys from prefixes of a given query.
 * Predictive searches are to find keys starting with a given query.

The biggest advantage of *marisa-trie-alpha* is that it can build a considerably compact dictionary. See below for the size of dictionaries built with various trie implementations.
